Specifically, this idea was born within the company Nastrafarm S.L., where I, as a volunteer, recognized the challenges faced in managing farm data efficiently. Traditional farm management methods often involve manual data entry, paper records, and disconnected systems that lead to inefficiencies, errors, and delays in decision-making. Recognizing these challenges, I decided to develop this API not just as a simple application with authentication and basic database records, but as a robust tool that integrates official services such as the Gesti\u00f3 Telem\u00e0tica Ramadera (GTR) of Catalonia, services from Spain\u2019s Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAPA), SMTP services, PDF and XLSX document generation, and potentially even electronically signable veterinary prescriptions and treatment records. The API connects to various third-party platforms to simplify and digitize the everyday operations of farmers.","title":"Project Inspiration"},{"location":"api/gtr-services/","text":"The API integrates the official GTR (Gesti\u00f3 Telem\u00e0tica Ramadera) platform services to streamline the complete management of animal movements via web services, enabling efficient and reliable communication between farms and authorities. The GTR platform is designed to manage animal mobility through files or web services, especially useful for high-volume data processes, ensuring traceability and regulatory compliance. Note: A mobility password is required to access GTR services. It can be requested using the following form: Request Mobility Password Integrated Services 1. Guide Registration (Alta de Gu\u00edas) Allows mass registration of mobility guides for animal transport. Validates business rules and animal data (species, number, origin/destination farms). Supports scheduling, transport info, and creation of DST documents. Enables efficient batch creation of transport guides. GTR Official Service Documentation: Guide Registration Service Documentation (PDF) 2. Movement Confirmation (Confirmaci\u00f3n de Movimientos de Entrada) Enables confirmation of animal arrivals at the destination farm. Updates guide and movement status in the system. Supports time stamping and optional comments. Ensures traceability and validation of animal transports. GTR Official Service Documentation: Movement Confirmation Service Documentation (PDF) 3. Guide Update (Actualizaci\u00f3n de Gu\u00edas) Allows updates to existing mobility guides for corrections or status changes. Modify data of DST guides downloaded and processed on mobile apps. Changes guide status to \u201cIssued\u201d and mobility status to \u201cClosed\u201d after update. Communication via REST/HTTPS with specific endpoints for download and update. Validates authentication and business rules before processing. Returns detailed error codes for various validation failures.
